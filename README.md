# Optimizing-RNN-parameters-using-Genetic-Algorithms
In this project, genetic algorithm has been used to fine tune parameters used to train an RNN for wind power forecasting. The best number of LSTM units and ther optimal window size to be used for prediction are found using GA. For deep learning, Keras library is used and for GA, DEAP library has been used. 

This project is an implementation of [this](http://aqibsaeed.github.io/2017-08-11-genetic-algorithm-for-optimizing-rnn/) blog. The code has been referred from [here](https://github.com/aqibsaeed/Genetic-Algorithm-RNN).
